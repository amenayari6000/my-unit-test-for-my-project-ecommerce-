# Unit Tests for Ecommerce Android App

This repository contains unit tests for my **Ecommerce Android application**, developed using **MVVM architecture** with **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection. The tests are written in **JUnit 4** and cover:

- **Repository layer**: Testing data sources and business logic.  
- **Use cases**: Ensuring correct behavior of domain logic.  
- **Presentation layer**: Validating ViewModel functions.  

These tests help maintain app reliability and ensure smooth functionality.
